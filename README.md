Hello there!
===========
## What is this repository?
When I am writing this, I am student in University of Delhi, India. Pursuing MSc in Computer Science.
As the lab and seat is not constant, the programs I made in practical might get lost. So I am uploading it here.

## If you are not me :
If you are my classmate or junior, feel free to use this repo. Of course, don't just copy paste it. But you can use it as
help. Although I am not a pro, you get the gist of what I am trying to program.

## If you are me :
Yeah it was you who wrote this, it was you who made these programs. I know you forgot, now use this as refernece before exam. Good luck.
# GO ME!
